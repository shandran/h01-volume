## Jupyter Notebook files

Use [`h01_plotly_visualizer.ipynb`](https://github.com/shandran/h01-volume/blob/main/notebooks/h01_plotly_visualizer.ipynb) to generate a 2D and 3D interactive views of one or more cells of interest from the H01 volume. Uses matplotlib and plotly visualization methods. See an example visualization below. Note that many cell meshes are enormous (1 GB) and may cause memory allocation issues on typical computer systems.
